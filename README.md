## About me

My name is Gustavo , I am a PhD in Sciences, chemist, completing the course in Data Science and enthusiast of building solutions involving the use of data. Here you are going to find some cool projects in the field of data science as well as some academic projects in the field of untargeted metabolomics. Feel free to get in touch!

# Data Science projects


### **[Store Sales Prediction](https://github.com/GustavoHBDuarte/store-sales-estimator)** 

Rossmann drug store store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance.
Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of the results can be quite varied.

Therefore a machine learning model was implemented aimed to forecast daily sales for six weeks. The corresponding model was further successfully deployed in order to provide predictions to be consumed by a Telegram bot.<br>

### **[Financial Fraud Detection](https://github.com/GustavoHBDuarte/fraud-detection)** 

This project mainly focused on detecting new fraudulent transactions based on historical data. Our fictitious company named Transaction Tracker offers for clients a service that tracks and searches for fraud in a certain financial transaction. For this purpose, a machine learning algorithm was trained and validated, and the predictions can be accessed via API requests. In a simulated scenario, considering the test dataset, if implemented, the solution could lead to a total profit of 845,471,888.32 for Transaction Tracker.<br>

### **[Clustering Customers](https://github.com/GustavoHBDuarte/clustering-customers)** 

In this project machine learning, clustering algorithms were used to segment customers from an e-commerce in different groups with focus on the most valuable customers to join the loyalty program (Golden customers). After developing the pipeline locally, the corresponding solution was implemented in the cloud environment, where the information about purchase transactions and clustered customers can be consulted via SQL query and accessed by any data visualization tool.<br>


# Metabolomics projects


### **[Rosuvastatin Absorption Estimator - Predicting AUC and C<sub>max</sub>](https://github.com/GustavoHBDuarte/Metabolomics_PK_proj)** 

Briefly, this project aimed to develop regression models able to predict the extent of absorption (Cmax and AUC) of the lipid-lowering agent Rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers. Input data was acquired from Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis of serum samples. Corresponding work was published in Frontiers in Pharmacology: Front. Pharmacol., 12 November 2021 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.752960 <br>
